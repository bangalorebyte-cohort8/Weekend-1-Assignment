Challenge #1

Using the file "words.txt" in this repo, write a function that reads the words in words.txt
and stores them as keys in a dictionary. It doesnâ€™t matter what the values are.
Use the 'in' operator to find if a word is in the dictionary.

    d[i] = i # To add items to the dictionary, you can use square brackets.
